a) **Description**: A graphical Tetris game; a shape/tile matching game based on lining up tiles to eliminate them and gain points.  
  
b) **User Stories that Describe the Software**:  

* As a player I want to control pieces as they fall down so that I can line them up correctly and score points.  
* As a player I want to be able to move them side to side so that I can properly control the pieces.  
* As a player I want to be able to force pieces down the board so that I can control the flow of the game.  
* As a gamer/player I want to be able to play a game just like classical Tetris so that I can experience a game that is 
familiar to me.   

c) **Does is run?**: Yes it runs. The game plays like classical Tetris, except for a few bugs like rotation which cause the game to break (as well as there is no music playing).  

d) **User Stories of Future Features**:  

* As a gamer/player I want to be able to play in a different mode so that I can experience Tetris in a different/new way.   
* As a player I want to be able to rotate pieces so that I can align them properly and score more points during the game.  
* As a player I want to be able to hear the classic Tetris game song so that I can sing along embarrassingly.  
* As a user I want to be able to access the rules/controls from the main menu so that I do not lose valuable playing time trying to figure out how to play the game.  

e) **Quality of README**: Pretty barren, it only says the name of the game and provides no further information. Some useful additions would be the rules of the game, the controls, a description of current major bugs, and a general description of the classes used to implement the game. Some screenshots of game play might also be nice to include.

f) **Quality of build.xml**: Right now it compiles, runs, cleans, runs tests, creates the javadoc, and generate a jar file. All targets have descriptions. It looks fine and updated.

g) **Quality of Issues**: There's around 1200 points worth of issues, none of which seem too difficult to implement by the end of the quarter. They seem to address most of the errors/missing features we've seen while trying to play the game ourselves. There's only one issue that seems vague and it's the issue regarding the GUI (this is because some elements of the GUI have been implemented while others are still missing).  
  
h) **Additional issues**: 

* We added an [issue regarding adding a rules page](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-tetris/issues/19) to the main menu instead of an in-game rules page.  
* We added an [issue about adding/improving javadoc comments](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-tetris/issues/20)
* We added an [issue about refactoring code in `TetrisBoard` class](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-tetris/issues/21)
* We added an [issue about name ambiguity is `Type_` classes](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-tetris/issues/22)

i) **Code Review**:

* All source java files, test files, and music files lumped together in source file (no organization of files in src directory).
* All the classes are rather clearly related to each other.
* There are extra backup files lying around in the src directory that should be removed.
* `MenuButtons` class seems superfluous because all other Buttons are already implemented in the `TetrisBoard` class. This might be an indicator of organizational/refactoring issues (either incomplete or misguided). This is because multiple UI elements should be implemented with inner classes.
* There are some indentation issues/formatting issues (like in the `Block` class there is a whole function where its body is not indented).
* The `Block` class has relevant subclasses, showing a solid understanding and use of inheritance and polymorphism in the code.
* The methods of each class are all named appropriately and pretty clearly explain what they're meant to do. For example the `Block` class has a `rotate()`, `getBlock()`, `getRowCol()` and `display()` methods.
* For all the Type_ classes (i.e. `Type1`, `Type2`) their names are a little ambiguous (because you don't know they are types of `Block`s until you see the source code).
* The `display()` function in the `Block` class has a for loop within another for loop, which may be inefficient. It may be worth looking into whether there are more efficient ways to display the block or represent the board.
* It seems that everything is crammed into the `TetrisBoard` class (as it is almost 1000 lines long) and has a lot of potential for refactoring. The `TetrisBoard` class is the main class for the game and therefore should not be as cluttered. 
* Javadoc comments are not entirely descriptive or helpful. 

j) **Quality of Tests**:  

* The tests are poor because all of the `Block` class tests for the `rotate()` function pass when the `rotate()` function does not work when playing the game.
* An entire test is commented out (`BoardTest`).
* Overall the Tetris game is not really being tested at all and needs major work in this area. All of the tests pass yet there are major issues present in the game which is not a good sign.
