##W16 Final Remarks
The game started out very bare, and needed a lot of improvement. We are
thankful for the previous group doing most of the GUI legwork for the basics of the
game. As it stands the game is currently mostly functional and can be played fairly well.
However, the bulk of the issues that need to be taken care of involve fixing
bugs and tests (rather than new features). Most of these probably revovle around the complicated nature of the
code in the TetrisBoard class. The process of refactoring and cleaning the code is still
an ongoing one. 

Good luck, have fun!

Best,
    Skyler and Davina
